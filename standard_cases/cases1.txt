- Generative AI is a general-purpose technology like the internet, and existing expertise for applications of such a technology already exists in many different agencies, rather than requiring a new AI regulatory agency.
- Engineers are usually less familiar with and more terrified by non-deterministic, high-stakes situations than politicians and lawyers, which may color how engineers evaluate potential regulation of highly stochastic generative AI algorithms.
- There is a need for a "middle distance view" of AI that focuses on the general, policy-relevant characteristics of the technology and industry, rather than being too deep in the weeds or throwing around generalities.
- Generative AI is a "tradition machine" that extends existing patterns, which may open new vistas in natural sciences but could also lead to more continuity, conformity, and conventionality in the realm of human-made patterns like social sciences, arts, and culture.
- The potential benefits of generative AI as a tradition machine include applying established knowledge and wisdom to new situations and freeing up human creativity, while the potential downsides include making society more of what it already is and driving rigidity or conformity.
- Generative AI presents less of an existential threat and more of an existentialist challenge, as it may tend to let us become more like we already are and want to be, which requires us to worry about our desires as a society.
